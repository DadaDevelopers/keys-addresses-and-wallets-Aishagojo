1. What is the difference between hardened and non-hardened keys?
Hardened keys are safer because they use the parent private key to create new keys.
You cannot make child keys from only a public key, so they are more secure.
Non-hardened keys use the parent public key to create child keys.
You can make new addresses using only the public key, but if someone gets a child private key and the parent public key, they can find the parent private key.
In short, hardened keys are more secure, while non-hardened keys are more flexible but less safe.

2. Why should a wallet developer prefer deterministic wallets over non-deterministic wallets?
Deterministic wallets (HD wallets) create all keys from one seed phrase, such as 12 words.
They are easy to back up because one seed restores everything.
They are organized and can generate many addresses in order.
They are also safer because you do not need to store each private key separately.
Non-deterministic wallets make random keys each time, which makes them harder to back up and easier to lose access to.
In short, deterministic wallets are easier to back up, organized, and safer, while non-deterministic wallets are harder to manage and riskier.
